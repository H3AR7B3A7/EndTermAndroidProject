End term assignment for the city of Brussels

Property of: Erasmus highschool of Bruxelles

The assignment was to create an application for the city of Brussels.
It had to showcase data of a striproute provided by an api by the city and store it locally.
Several other functionalities could only improve our mark once the MVP had been met.
We had about 3 weeks to present the results.

This was an early introduction to android development and in no way intended for commercial use.

Special thanks to: Swasse
